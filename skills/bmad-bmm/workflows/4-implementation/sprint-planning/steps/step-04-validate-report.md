<action>Perform validation checks:</action>

- [ ] Every epic in epic files appears in {status_file}
- [ ] Every story in epic files appears in {status_file}
- [ ] Every epic has a corresponding retrospective entry
- [ ] No items in {status_file} that don't exist in epic files
- [ ] All status values are legal (match state machine definitions)
- [ ] File is valid YAML syntax

**Sprint Status Generated Successfully**

- **File Location:** {status_file}
- **Total Epics:** {{epic_count}}
- **Total Stories:** {{story_count}}
- **Epics In Progress:** {{epics_in_progress_count}}
- **Stories Completed:** {{done_count}}

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the generated {status_file}
2. Use this file to track development progress
3. Agents will update statuses as they work
4. Re-run this workflow to refresh auto-detected statuses

## Additional Documentation

### Status State Machine

**Epic Status Flow:**

~~~
backlog → in-progress → done
~~~

- **backlog**: Epic not yet started
- **in-progress**: Epic actively being worked on (stories being created/implemented)
- **done**: All stories in epic completed

**Story Status Flow:**

~~~
backlog → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → done
~~~

- **backlog**: Story only exists in epic file
- **ready-for-dev**: Story file created (e.g., `stories/1-3-plant-naming.md`)
- **in-progress**: Developer actively working
- **review**: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
- **done**: Completed

**Retrospective Status:**

~~~
optional ↔ done
~~~

- **optional**: Ready to be conducted but not required
- **done**: Finished

### Guidelines

1. **Epic Activation**: Mark epic as `in-progress` when starting work on its first story
2. **Sequential Default**: Stories are typically worked in order, but parallel work is supported
3. **Parallel Work Supported**: Multiple stories can be `in-progress` if team capacity allows
4. **Review Before Done**: Stories should pass through `review` before `done`
5. **Learning Transfer**: SM typically creates next story after previous one is `done` to incorporate learnings
