# BMAD Method for Agent Zero

**Structured AI-assisted software development — from idea to shipped code.**

BMAD (Business Method for Agile Development) is a structured AI-first product development framework. This plugin provides a full drop-in integration: 20 specialized agent personas, 5 global skills, and the complete workflow library — ready to use inside Agent Zero.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install the plugin**

Install via the Agent Zero Plugin Hub, or clone directly into your Agent Zero plugins folder:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/vanja-emichi/bmad_method.git usr/plugins/bmad-method
~~~

**2. Initialize a BMAD project**

Select the **BMad Master** profile in Agent Zero, then run:

~~~
bmad init
~~~

This sets up the project workspace, creates the `.a0proj/` configuration directory, and initializes project-scoped memory.

**3. Start building**

Tell BMad Master what you want to build. It routes you to the right specialist for your current phase — no manual agent selection needed.

---

## How It Works

BMAD organizes software development into phases — Ideation → Planning → Architecture → Implementation → Testing. Each phase has one or more specialist agents who own it.

You start every session by talking to **BMad Master**, the orchestrator. It reads your project state and routes you to the right specialist. Specialists produce artifacts — briefs, PRDs, architecture docs, user stories, test plans — that the next phase consumes.

Project state is tracked across sessions. Decisions made by the architect are visible to the developer. The sprint board survives restarts.

~~~
User → BMad Master → [routes to specialist] → artifact produced → state updated → next phase
~~~

## Prompt Architecture

Each BMAD agent is built from a clean 3-layer boundary:

~~~
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Prompts  (WHO the agent is)                      │
│  role.md · communication.md · tips.md ·                 │
│  communication_additions.md                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Skills  (WHAT to execute)                              │
│  SKILL.md — workflow routing, paths, execution protocol │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Project Instructions  (WHERE the project is)           │
│  .a0proj/instructions/ — state, config, paths           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
~~~

**Agent prompts** define persona, communication style, and menu presentation.
**Skills** are loaded on-demand and contain all workflow execution logic.
**Project instructions** are written by `bmad init` and contain project-specific state and configuration.

## Extension Pipeline

| Extension | Hook | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `_80_bmad_routing_manifest.py` | `message_loop_prompts_after` | Dynamically builds routing manifest from `skills/*/module-help.csv`, filesystem artifact detection, and staleness warnings |

---

## Memory Architecture

- **Project-level FAISS store** — `.a0proj/memory/` — single vector database shared by all agents (structural isolation)
- **Knowledge preload** — `.a0proj/knowledge/main/` — recursive FAISS scan on agent init
- **No per-agent stores** — project-level isolation with cross-agent recall by design

---

## Dashboard

BMAD ships a live project status dashboard. After installation, the BMAD button appears in Agent Zero's sidebar.

The dashboard is **read-only** — it observes agent state without writing to it.
